# Asymmetric Encryption Chat Application

This application demonstrates a secure chat application utilizing asymmetric encryption methods.

## Key Features
- **Privacy**: Messages are encrypted in such a way that even the server cannot access the contents. Only the intended recipient holds the decryption key.
- **Security**: Employs advanced cryptographic algorithms to ensure message integrity and confidentiality.

## How It Works
1. **Message Encryption**: The sender encrypts the message using the recipient's public key.
2. **Message Transmission**: The encrypted message is sent to the server.
3. **Message Decryption**: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message, ensuring security and privacy.

## Benefits
- Ensures that only the intended recipient can read the messages.
- Reduces the risk of data breaches by keeping encrypted messages inaccessible to unauthorized parties.

This technology is essential for building secure communication systems in today's digital landscape.
